      <description>For one of my first assignments in CS 2420 (Data Structures and Algorithms) at the University of Utah, we were tasked with writing sudoku solvers using both a constraint-based algorithm and a recursive brute force algorithm. While the assignment was initially in Java, I currently have an interest in learning Rust, so I decided to implement the recursive solver in Rust as well. The source code can be found here. It is very fast, solving even a 17 clue puzzle (the minimum possible with a unique solution), in just over a millisecond.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new blog! This will be a collection of musings related to my computer science studies, my personal coding projects, my hobbies, and my exploration of bioinformatics. While nothing here will be novel, it should give you a basic idea of who I am and what I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing in my life.</description>
